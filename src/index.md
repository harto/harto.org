Hello! I'm Stuart Campbell, a <del>Melbourne-based</del> San Francisco-based
Australian programmer that works at [99designs][99].

Outside of work I play drums in [Midnight Caller][mc] and bass guitar in
[White Woods][ww]. I'm also into such other fascinating shit as cooking, gaming
and riding my bicycle.

This site is my dumping ground for various [experiments](/junk), code snippets
and occasional blog posts.

You can find me elsewhere on the web at [GitHub][gh], [Google+][g+] and
[Twitter][twitter], or contact me at [stuart@harto.org][email].
