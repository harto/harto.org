title: I have a new job
---

After nearly 4 years at [99designs][99d], I've decided that the time is right
for me to move on to something different.

I'm very proud of the work we've done at 99designs. I think the recent rebrand
looks great and the platform is bigger, better, and fairer than ever before. The
team has a bright future and I'm going to miss everyone.

As for my next move: I'm excited to be joining the team at [Spot][spot], where
I'll be helping to build out some of the backend systems that power the iOS app.
Spot is trying to improve the world of local & travel recommendations, something
that resonates with me personally, and the team seems very friendly and smart.

How exciting!
