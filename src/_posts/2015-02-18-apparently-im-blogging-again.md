I'm going to start blogging again. I kept a blog on [Posterous][posterous] a few
years ago, but fell out of the habit.

This time around I'll try to write short posts. We tend to write very long,
infrequent posts for the [99designs tech blog][99-blog]. That form takes a lot
of work and pressures the author to make each post perfect, which might be why
we don't publish very often.
